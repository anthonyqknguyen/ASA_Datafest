# ASA_Datafest
Repository of my participation at the ASA Datafest at Virginia Tech

Project was done in Deepnote so that we could work collaboratively in real time.
Data provided from the ASA Datafest has been removed under the NDA.
PDF files of our write up and powerpoint slides are available upon request. It seems like Github does not like them very much.

Teammates include:
  Nicole Dao
  Keith Le
  Alan Devara
